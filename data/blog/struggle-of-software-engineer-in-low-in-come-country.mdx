summary: Software engineering is a field that transcends geographical boundaries. The skills, expertise, and dedication required to excel in this profession are universal, regardless of where one practices it. However, the reality is that compensation in the tech industry can vary significantly across different regions, leading to stark disparities that are difficult to ignore.

Software engineers in low-income countries, such as Vietnam,
often face the challenge of lower salaries, even though they have the same skills,
expertise, and dedication required to excel in their profession as their counterparts in more affluent nations.
This disparity in compensation can have a significant impact on the financial well-being, morale, motivation,
and sense of professional worth of software engineers in low-income countries.

Addressing this issue requires a collective effort from various stakeholders.
Employers need to acknowledge and appreciate the value software engineers bring to their organizations, irrespective of their location.
They should strive to ensure that payment is based on skills, experience, and contributions rather than solely on geographical factors.

We must also raise awareness and engage in open conversations about the disparities in compensation.
Let's remember that the worth of a software engineer should not be determined by their location but by the skills,
expertise, and value they bring to their work.

Happy coding!
